# Michigan Electric Vehicle Center (EVC) Vehicle Simulation GitHub
This GitHub repository demonstrates the process of creating increasingly complex vehicle models. For example, it includes parameters for the Supermileage vehicle currently under development. The vehicle is modeled driving at the Sonoma Raceway, using a preliminary strategy for the Shell Eco-Marathon competition. However, these models are designed to be easily configurable for any application.

## Part 1: [Road Load Basic](/1_Road_Load_Basic)
- TODO: Point mass & forces acting upon it
- TODO: Add pic of the driver glider.
- TODO: Simple constant speed, acceleration, etc.
- TODO: What it doesn't account for. 

## Part 2: [Drive Cycle Generation](/2_Drive_Cycle_Generation)
- TODO: Describe the process of creating drive cycle data for this code.

## Part 3: Driver Glider
- TODO: What does driver glider add in comparison to the basic road load
- TODO: Describe model
- TODO: Describe what it's missing
- TODO: Describe process of changing the drive strategy until it's feasible, etc. 

## Part 4: EV Simple
- TODO: Describe how this adds upon the Driver Glider
- TODO: Describe what assumptions are made
- TODO: Describe what still isn't modeled

## Part 5: Efficiency Map
- TODO: Describe purpose of this code
- TODO: Describe how to place it wihin the context of EV Simple and future models.
